This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) . Since I started using Scala this year, this will most
likely be all in Scala. Beware that the code might look a bit enterprisey, since I'm definitely going for any code golf business here.

To compile and run, you will need [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org). 

To compile, you need to execute
```
sbt compile
``` 
To run a particular solution, you currently need to edit the `SolutionRunner` file, and then run 
```
sbt run
```

In the future I plan to add some abstraction at some point, so that you can run a desired solution without changing the code.
